# React Todo App

## Motivation
I created this app in order to practice using state in React. Although this is simple, I gained a better understanding of passing data through a React app. As of now, the todos are hard-coded in (TodoData.ja), but I hope to update this app to incorporate user-functionality. I would like to add a simple text box where users can input their own todos (this will most likely be a MERN app).
